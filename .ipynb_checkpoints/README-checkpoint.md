# Music Genre Classification

## Project Overview
This project is a **Music Genre Classification** system built using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  
It analyzes audio features from music tracks and predicts their genre using machine learning algorithms.

The main objectives of this project are:
- Explore and preprocess music datasets.
- Extract meaningful audio features.
- Build a machine learning model to classify music tracks into genres.
- Visualize the dataset and model performance.

# How to Run
